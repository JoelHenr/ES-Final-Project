# ES-Final-Project
This is a study to observe whether tennis players have an advantage by winning the coin toss at the beginning of the match. 

In order to replicate this study, go to the file name titled "Es Project.R". Download file in RStudio or equivalent environments and source the code. First the code will run a linear regression for "Model 1" described in file RP Final PDF. The second model that will be generated is a multivariable regression known as "Model 2" in the paper as well. These regressions will emphasize the marginal effects that winning the coin tosses will have on the winning percentage of tennis matches.
